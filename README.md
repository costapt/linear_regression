# linear_regression
First experience with theano library.

This script creates a 2D synthetic dataset that corresponds to x^2 with some
added noise. It then tries to fit a model to that dataset and plots the results.

This is a very simple example of a Linear Regression method. By adding additional
features, it can fit non-linear curves, such as the x^2 curve.

Still needs some improvements:
 - Regularization should be added
 - The Learning rate should be dynamic
 - The algorithm to add new features should be improved
